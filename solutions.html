Round 3

- First, we can see by counting known scores that the winning team must be players 2 and 4.  By counting the number of points the opponents score, we see that they must score exactly 5 additional points.  The only possibility for this is for the unknown card in trick 3 to be a 5.  Their remaining tricks must not earn them points
- Therefore, the first tractor in trick 2 cannot contain a pair of fives, and so must contain a pair of threes.
- Let's rule out a bomb in trick 2.  The only possibility is a bomb of 4s.  In this case, the tractor in that trick is with 2s.  But now there are a single 2 and 3 unplayable, since there is no 4 to make the straight.  Only 1 card gets left unplayed so this is impossible.
- Since the third play in trick 2 must be a tractor, we see by process of elimination it must be 99TT
- Now, the play of 6 cards, by process of elimination, cannot be a pair of triples or triple of pairs.  The only possible straight is 234567.  
- The triple in trick 8 now must be of 4s.
- What remains is straightforward

Round 4

- First, notice of the 5 unplayed cards, four of them are the 4 special cards.  Dog is recognizable by the trick pattern, and the rest are recognizable by the choice in parentheses.  We will assume no special cards, throughout
- Now, notice that in the second trick, both hands must be full houses, since no straight (bomb) can end in a 4.  
- In trick 5, the only possibilities are 444555, 445566, and 456789.  444555 is impossible since we've observed two 4s already.  456789 is impossible since a fourth 4 and 9 prevents the straight of 7 from being possible.  Thus it is 445566.
- Since all 4s are used, the straight must be 5-J.
- By process of elimination, the card in trick 6 is an A
- Now, by process of elimination, the full houses are 7s over 9s, and 8s over 4s.
- So of the 2 remaining aces, at least one is played.  In fact, only there is only 1 valid spot.  Thus the last 5th unplayed card is also an ace.
- The last 3 cards are straightforward
