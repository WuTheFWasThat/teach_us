Round 3

- First, we can see by counting known scores that the winning team must be players 2 and 4.  By counting the number of points the opponents score, we see that they must score exactly 5 additional points.  The only possibility for this is for the unknown card in trick 3 to be a 5.  Their remaining tricks must not earn them points
- Therefore, the first tractor in trick 2 cannot contain a pair of fives, and so must contain a pair of threes.
- Let's rule out a bomb in trick 2.  The only possibility is a bomb of 4s.  In this case, the tractor in that trick is with 2s.  But now there are a single 2 and 3 unplayable, since there is no 4 to make the straight.  Only 1 card gets left unplayed so this is impossible.
- Since the third play in trick 2 must be a tractor, we see by process of elimination it must be 99TT
- Now, the play of 6 cards, by process of elimination, cannot be a pair of triples or triple of pairs.  The only possible straight is 234567.  
- The triple in trick 8 now must be of 4s.
- What remains is straightforward
